# GameMaker Feature Requests have now moved to the [GameMaker Bugs repo](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"feature+request")
 
Welcome to the home for GameMaker Feature Requests! 

Here you can suggest, request, and vote on new features for the GameMaker IDE and Runtime. 

We value user feedback and strive to make GameMaker the best it can be for developers. By submitting a feature request, you can help us make Gamemaker even better. 

Before submitting please read the following information carefully and search the existing feature requests to ensure that it has not already been submitted. 

## What to include 

When submitting a feature request, please provide:
* A brief title of the feature you want added 
* A clear description of the issue that your feature is solving
* A description of the feature
* Any alternative suggestions that may also resolve the issue
* Any additional information that will help us understand the issue better

## Feature Request Process 

All new GameMaker Feature Requests are regularly reviewed by a multidisciplinary team here at Gamemaker, with all aspects taken into consideration.

We curate requests carefully and will evaluate your request in terms of its possibility, difficulty, usability, and value to GameMaker.

Once a request has been reviewed it will either be rejected with a reason why or added to the backlog where anyone can vote on features by leaving a thumbs up or thumbs down.

Votes will be periodically reviewed and, when it fits with our schedule, will be added to GameMaker.

Please note that you may not have advanced notification of your request being worked on but it will be closed once it has been added to GameMaker.


We thank you for your feedback and look forward to hearing your feature requests!
